There are three pieces to og-image that are worth noting before you begin development.

The backend image generator located in /api/index.ts
The html/css template used to generate the image is located in /_lib/template.ts
The frontend inputs located in /web/index.ts
Vercel handles routing in an elegant way for us so deployment is easy.

To start hacking, do the following:

Clone this repo with git clone https://github.com/vercel/og-image
Change directory with cd og-image
Run yarn or npm install to install all dependencies
Run locally with vercel dev and visit localhost:3000 (if nothing happens, run npm install -g vercel)
If necessary, edit the exePath in options.ts to point to your local Chrome executable
Now you're ready to start local development!

You can set an environment variable to assist with debugging export OG_HTML_DEBUG=1. This will render the image as HTML so you can play around with your browser's dev tools before committing changes to the template.
